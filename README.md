<h2 align="center">About OCA</h2>
 <p align="center">

OCA (Occurrence Context Assistant) is a streamlined application designed to assist citizens in resolving social and environmental occurrences by rapidly identifying and presenting key resources. Leveraging web search and crawling capabilities, OCA gathers information from government institutions and organizations relevant to the geolocation and context of the occurrence.

The assistant refines suggestions based on Brazilian laws, ensuring that users are provided with actionable, accurate information to address issues such as deforestation, fires, or accidents. It also compiles multi-channel contact information (email, phone, SMS, WhatsApp) for relevant authorities or support services, facilitating swift responses.

This solution prioritizes simplicity and accessibility, aiming to empower communities in areas with limited connectivity by enabling timely and informed decision-making. 
Submitted as part of the Hackathon Llama-Pan-LATAM.
